# We Achieve
An iOS application that connects underrepresented groups to educational and job opportunities.

## Audience
Underrepresented groups in the education and/or job industry.

## Experience
A user is prompted to log in with an email, Facebook, or Google account and is then taken to the Search page. The search page will act as sort of the home view as well as where searches are displayed, and it will also contain a tab bar controller that can take the user to a favorited opportunities page or their profile.
